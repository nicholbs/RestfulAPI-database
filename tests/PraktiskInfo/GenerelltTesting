Tests can be started with the run command:
- php vendor/bin/codecept run

With the first argument you can run all tests from one suite:
- php vendor/bin/codecept run acceptance

To limit tests run to a single class, add a second argument. Provide a local path to the test class, from the suite directory:
- php vendor/bin/codecept run acceptance SigninCest.php

Alternatively you can provide the full path to test file:
- php vendor/bin/codecept run tests/acceptance/SigninCest.php

You can further filter which tests are run by appending a method name to the class, separated by a colon (for Cest or Test formats):
- php vendor/bin/codecept run tests/acceptance/SigninCest.php:^anonymousLogin$

You can provide a directory path as well. This will execute all acceptance tests from the backend dir:
- php vendor/bin/codecept run tests/acceptance/backend

Using regular expressions, you can even run many different test methods from the same directory or class. For example, this will execute all acceptance tests from the backend dir beginning with the word “login”:
- php vendor/bin/codecept run tests/acceptance/backend:^login

To execute a group of tests that are not stored in the same directory, you can organize them in groups.


REPORTS
To generate JUnit XML output, you can provide the --xml option, and --html for HTML report.
- php vendor/bin/codecept run --steps --xml --html
This command will run all tests for all suites, displaying the steps, and building HTML and XML reports. Reports will be stored in the tests/_output/ directory.

To see all the available options, run the following command:
- php vendor/bin/codecept help run
